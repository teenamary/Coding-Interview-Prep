Q4. How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?

Ans:
Approach: A simple solution is be traverse each element and check if thereâ€™s another number in the array which can be added to it to give sum.

# Python3 implementation of simple method to find count of pairs with given sum. 
  
# Returns number of pairs in arr[0..n-1]  with sum equal to 'sum' 
def getPairsCount(arr, n, sum): 
      
    count = 0 # Initialize result 
  
    # Consider all possible pairs 
    # and check their sums 
    for i in range(0, n): 
        for j in range(i + 1, n): 
            if arr[i] + arr[j] == sum: 
                count += 1
      
    return count 
  
# Driver function  
arr = [1, 5, 7, -1, 5] 
n = len(arr) 
sum = 6
print("Count of pairs is", 
      getPairsCount(arr, n, sum)) 

Time Complexity : O(n^2)
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
