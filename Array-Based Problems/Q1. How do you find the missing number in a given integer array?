Q1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array?

Ans:
Approach: The length of the array is n-1. So the sum of all n elements, i.e sum of numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. 
Now find the sum of all the elements in the array and subtract it from the sum of first n natural numbers, it will be the value of the missing element.
Algorithm:
Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers as sumtotal= n*(n+1)/2
create a variable sum to store the sum of array elements.
Traverse the array from start to end.
Update the value of sum as sum = sum + array[i]
print the missing number as sumtotal â€“ sum

# getMissingNo takes list as argument 
def getMissingNo(A): 
    n = len(A) 
    total = (n + 1)*(n + 2)/2
    sum_of_A = sum(A) 
    return total - sum_of_A 
  
# Driver program to test the above function 
A = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 
miss = getMissingNo(A) 
print(miss)

Compelxity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n).
Only one traversal of array is needed.
Space Complexity: O(1).
No extra space is needed
