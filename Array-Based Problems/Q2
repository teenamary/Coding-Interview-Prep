Q2. How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?

Ans:
Approach: Traverse the array once. While traversing, keep track of count of all elements in the array using a temp array count[] of size n, when you see an element 
whose count is already set, print it as duplicate.

This method uses the range given in the question to restrict the size of count[], but doesnâ€™t use the data that there are only two repeating elements.
# Python3 code for Find the two repeating  
# elements in a given array 
  
  
def printRepeating(arr,size) : 
    count = [0] * size 
    print(" Repeating elements are ",end = "") 
    for i in range(0, size) : 
        if(count[arr[i]] == 1) : 
            print(arr[i], end = " ") 
        else : 
            count[arr[i]] = count[arr[i]] + 1
  
  
# Driver code 
arr = [4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1] 
arr_size = len(arr) 
printRepeating(arr, arr_size) 

Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
